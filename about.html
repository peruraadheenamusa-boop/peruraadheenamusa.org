<h2>Our Heritage</h2>
<p>
    Perur Aadheenam USA represents the American chapter of the historic Perur Aadheenam 
    in Coimbatore, India — a spiritual institution with more than 500 years of legacy 
    in the Tamil Saivite tradition. The Aadheenam belongs to the sacred Kailaya Meikandar 
    Guru Parambarai and is rooted in the spiritual significance of the Velliangiri Hills, 
    also known as “Then Kailayam” (South Kailash).
</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>
    The Aadheenam was founded in the early 17th century by Saint Shanthalinga Adigalar, 
    who received a divine vision of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi at the Shanthalinga 
    Peruman Thiru Kovil in Perur. Through the centuries, the Aadheenam has served as a 
    center for Tamil learning, Saivite philosophy, and community upliftment.
</p>

<h2>Revival & Service</h2>
<p>
    In the early 1900s, St. Ramaswamy Adigalar revitalized the Aadheenam and expanded 
    its educational and social outreach by establishing institutions such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gnanambigai Matriculation School</li>
    <li>Thavathiru Santhalinga Adigalar Arts & Science Tamil College</li>
    <li>Thavathiru Santhalinga Adigalar Higher Secondary School</li>
    <li>Arumuga Adigalar ThaiTamil Nursery & Primary School</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Aadheenam also supports rural healthcare, temple renovation projects, and is 
    currently working toward establishing a new multi-specialty hospital in 
    Mudalipalayam near Annur, Coimbatore.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission in the United States</h2>
