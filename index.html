    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Perur Aadheenam USA is the American chapter of the historic 500-year-old 
        Perur Aadheenam in Coimbatore, India. Our mission is to preserve Tamil 
        Saivite culture, support community education, and connect the Tamil 
        diaspora with the Aadheenam’s spiritual and charitable activities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rooted in the lineage of the Kailaya Meikandar Guru Parambarai, the Aadheenam 
        continues to serve through temple preservation, educational institutions, 
        and social service initiatives.
    </p>

    <p>
        We invite all devotees, Tamil families, and cultural organizations across 
        the United States to join us in sustaining this sacred heritage.
